### üéØ Project Goal

This project focuses on building an efficient and accurate **time series forecasting** model using the **LightGBM** (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) framework. The primary objective is to predict future values (likely sales or demand) for various items or stores based on historical data.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies and Libraries

* **Core Model:** `LightGBM` (for its speed and handling of large datasets).
* **Data Handling:** `Pandas`, `NumPy`.
* **Visualization:** `Matplotlib` (for plotting historical data vs. predictions).

### üìä Dataset and Context

The analysis uses data from a **Kaggle competition** (indicated by the metadata) involving predictions over time for different entities (`unique_id`).

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Target Variable** | `sales` or a similar time-dependent metric. |
| **Identifiers** | `unique_id` (combining item/store/etc. identifiers). |
| **Temporal Data** | `date` (used for feature engineering). |

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Steps and Methodology

1.  **Data Preparation:** Loading the training and testing datasets from the specified Kaggle source.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating relevant features crucial for time series models:
    * **Date Features:** Extracting temporal components (year, month, day of week, day of year).
    * **Lag Features:** Creating lagged versions of the target variable (`sales` at $t-1, t-7, t-30$, etc.) to capture recent trends and seasonality.
    * **Rolling Window Features:** Calculating moving averages or standard deviations over various time windows.
3.  **Model Training (LightGBM):**
    * The `LightGBM` classifier (or regressor, depending on the target type) is chosen for its superior performance, lower memory usage, and ability to handle categorical features efficiently.
    * Training the model on the engineered feature set.
4.  **Prediction and Visualization:**
    * Generating predictions on the test set.
    * Visualizing the historical data against the model's predictions for a chosen `unique_id` to evaluate forecast quality visually.

### üìà Key Advantages of LightGBM

* **Speed and Efficiency:** Significantly faster training speed compared to other GBM frameworks due to its reliance on Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS).
* **Handling of Large Data:** Optimized for processing large-scale data and reducing memory consumption.
